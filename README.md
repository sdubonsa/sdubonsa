# 👋 Hi, I’m Santiago Dubon (@sdubonsa)

### 📚 What am I learning?
I am currently a student at The University of North Carolina at Charlotte studying Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering!
<br>
<br> In addition to my degree, I am working on The Odin Project and the Scrimba curiculum to improve my web development skills. I am currently learning MongoDB, React, and Node.js on there!

### 🏗️ Projects
I am currently working on building a couple of different projects to improve my skills! You can check them all on my profile. <br>
You can also checkout my [digital business card](https://venerable-pastelito-e9ab03.netlify.app/)
